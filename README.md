## Download

The latest version is always available on the [releases page](https://github.com/cld9x/xbvr/releases).

Please note that during the first run XBVR automatically installs `ffprobe` and `ffmpeg` codecs from https://ffbinaries.com/downloads.

## Quick Start

Once launched, web UI is available at `http://127.0.0.1:9999`.

Before anything else, you must allow the app to scan sites and populate its scene metadata library. Click through to Options -> Scene Data and "Run scraper". This can take several minutes to complete. Wait for it to finish, and then go to Options -> Folders and add the folders where your video files are stored.

When it's all done, you should see your media not only in web UI, but also through DLNA server in your favourite VR player.

Enjoy!
