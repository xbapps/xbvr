## Download

The latest version is always available on the [releases page](https://github.com/xbapps/xbvr/releases).

App is also available in form of Docker image, which makes it possible to run in more specialized environments such as QNAP NAS - downloads at [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/xbapps/xbvr).

To run this container in docker:

```
docker run -t --name=xbvr --net=host --restart=always \
   --mount type=bind,source=/path/to/your/videos,target=/videos,readonly \
   --mount source=xbvr-config,target=/root/.config/ \
   xbapps/xbvr:latest
```

Adding `-d` to the docker command will run the container in the background.

In docker, your videos will be mounted at /videos and you should add this path in Options -> Folders.

Please note that during the first run XBVR automatically installs `ffprobe` and `ffmpeg` codecs from [ffbinaries site](https://ffbinaries.com/downloads).

## Quick Start

Once launched, web UI is available at `http://127.0.0.1:9999`.

Before anything else, you must allow the app to scan sites and populate its scene metadata library. Click through to Options -> Scene Data and "Run scraper". This can take several minutes to complete. Wait for it to finish, and then go to Options -> Folders and add the folders where your video files are stored.

When it's all done, you should see your media not only in web UI, but also through DLNA server in your favourite VR player.

Enjoy!

## Development

Make sure you have following installed:

- Go 1.13
- Node.js 12.x
- Yarn 1.17.x
- fileb0x (run `go get github.com/UnnoTed/fileb0x` outside project directory)
- air (run `go get github.com/cosmtrek/air` outside project directory)

Once all of the above is installed, running `yarn dev` from project directory launches file-watchers providing livereload for both Go and JavaScript.

## Development in Gitpod

This project is configured for use in Gitpod. It will provide you with a pre-built development environment with all the tools needed to compile XBVR.

When the workspace loads, `yarn dev` runs and it will build and start XBVR automatically. Every time you make a change to a file, watchers will automatically compile the relevant code.

Once XBVR is compiled and starts, a preview panel will open in the IDE. As you modify go files, the preview panel will reload with the latest changes. If you make changes to Vue, you'll need to reload the browser to load the updated JavaScript.

Currently, it's only possible to test XBVR core and Browser applications using Gitpod. Because DLNA requires a local network, you won't be able to connect to the DLNA server running in Gitpod. For most people, this is fine.

sqlite3 is included in the terminal. The XBVR database is located at /home/gitpod/.config/xbvr/main.db

sqlite-web is also included. To browse the db, you can run `sqlite_web /home/gitpod/.config/xbvr/main.db`.

Gitpod has GitHub integration and, once authorized, can fork this repo into your account, push/pull changes, and create pull requests.
